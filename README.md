# DOME Trust Framework

## Introduction

The DOME Trust Framework is a set of rules and guidelines that define the trust relationships between the different entities in the DOME network. The framework is composed of the following trusted lists:

## Trusted Lists
* Trusted Services List
* Trusted Access Node Operators List
* Trusted Schemas List
* Revoked Credential List
* Invalid Credentials List

## How-To Guides

### How-To insert a new value in the Trusted Lists

1. Fork the repository
2. Select the environment you want to add the organization to
3. Edit the YAML file adding your values
4. Create a pull request
5. Wait for the pull request to be approved â†’ This will need to be verified by the DOME Operator.
6. If the pull request is approved, the data will be added to the directory

### Which data is needed to set a new entry into the Trusted Services List?

### Which data is needed to set a new entry into the Trusted Invalid Credentials List?

You need to add the Verifiable Credential ID that you want to invalidate.

### Which data is needed to set a new entry into the Trusted Revoked Credentials List?

You need to add the Verifiable Credential ID that you want to invalidate.

### Which data is needed to set a new entry into the Trusted Access Node Operators List?

The directory of the Access Node contains the public data of the organizations that are part of the DOME network. If you need more information about how you can get or create your data, please, follow the [Access Node Guide](https://github.com/DOME-Marketplace/access-node/blob/main/README.md)
The data is stored in a YAML file that contains the following information:
```yaml
organizations:
  - name: "Organization 1"
    publicKey: "Mg5v8CDaEnJkSJfP1Q6Q6Q=="
    url: "https://organization1.com"
    dlt_address: "0x43b27fef24cfe8a0b797ed8a36de2884f9963c0c2a0da640e3ec7ad6cd0c493d"
  - name: "Organization 2"
    publicKey: "EsThbaGlaZIPB6xN6Q6Q6Q=="
    url: "https://123.162.194.139:8080"
    dlt_address: "0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce83...9613fffba74279579268"
```

> NOTE: The `publicKey` field is the public key of the organization that is used to verify the signature of the JWT token. It is the same public key related to the EthereumAddress of the organizations used in the DLT-Adapter.

> NOTE 2: The `url` must be the URL of the organization's Access Node, and it can be an IP address or a domain.

> NOTE 3: The `dlt_address`must be the Ethereum Address of the organization's Access Node.
